= Introduction =

This workshop aims at building a complete build and delivery pipeline, from developing and pushing code in a repository, to the deployment on a server.

For this purpose, we’ll use:

*Github as VCS:*
  * URL : https://github.com/xebia-france-training/
  * User/Password ?
  * There is one project per team

*Nexus as Binaries Repository:*
  * URL : http://nexus.xebia-tech-event.info:8081/nexus
  * User/Password : deployment/deployment123

*Jenkins as Integration Platform*
  * URL:Your Jenkins/Rundeck instance on port 8080

*A Rundeck Instance*
  * URL:Your Jenkins/Rundeck instance on port 4440
  * User/Password : admin/admin

*A modificated version of the ‘PetClinic’ application from SpringSource*

To integrate the concept of Continuous Delivery, we’ll use four different tools:
  * Jenkins with Remote SSH Plugin
  * Rundeck, open-source project from DTO Labs with the presence of Vincent Behard
  * maven-tomcat-plugin with the presence of Olivier Lamy
  * DeployIt from XebiaLabs with the presence Benoît Moussaud

For this hands-workshop, we’ll provide for each team:
  * an Virtual Machine with Jenkins and Rundeck
  * one Virtual Machine with Tomcat called ‘Dev’ and another called ‘QA’

Those Virtual Machines will be created in Xebia France account Amazon EC2 Account. Your email will be requested to get the public key and the different Public IP to get access to those EC2 instance.

Requirement for this workshop:
 * SSH client
 * Git client
 * Web browser
